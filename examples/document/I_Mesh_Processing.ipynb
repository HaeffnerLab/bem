    "This BEM package is used for for numerical simulating the electric field of ion traps in python style. Some external packages are wrapped in this package:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fast triangulation (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.research.html)\n",
    "* fastlap boundary element method (Nabors K S. Efficient three-dimensional capacitance calculation[D]. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document, also as a tutorial, explains how to numerical computing electric field and computing its multipole expansion coefficient starting from scratch with a fusion 360 trap model(take `./f3d/htrap_overhang_9x5mm.f3d` for example). Our document consists of three .ipynb files: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `I_Mesh_Processing.ipynb`\n",
    "* `II_Field_Simulation.ipynb`\n",
    "* `III_Multipole_Expansion.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "We split document into three files for some reasons:1. the most time consuming part `II_Field_Simulation.ipynb` could be taken out alone and run on HPC. 2.the intermediate result between files can be checked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going through three files in order and running their python code will help you understand our workflow. Generally our workflow divides into three steps, corresponding to the above three .ipynb files. Firstly we identify different electrodes of the trap model by different colors. Also, we refines the trap model meshes to prepare for the second step. The result is stored in `mesh_result.pkl`. Secondly, we simulate the electric potential with fastlap boundary element method(FMM), the accuracy of this step depends on the mesh size in the first step. The result is stored in `field_result.pkl`. Thirdly, we analyze the electric field. Our focus is the multipole coefficient of the field under specific voltage distribution.\n",

    "This .pynb file reads a colored model file `./inter_results/htrap.stl`, and assign names for each color(thus for each electrodes). The result is stored in `./inter_results/mesh_result.pkl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file we name different electrodes and refine the meshes. The size of mesh deternmines the accuracy in next step. You should set the mesh finer and finer until the result converges. Also, you can set the mesh finer and test the convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (1) color your electrodes (in fusion 360) and export stl\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you have a trap model in fusion 360 project, for example, `./f3d/htrap_overhang_9x5mm.f3d`.A trap always consists of different electrodes. Here we use different color to identify different electrodes(STL file stores color for each mesh). In fusion 360, you can assign different appearance for different parts, of which we only cares about the color(because stl file only stores color), not texture. We recommend to use ../../bemCol_lib/bemCol.adsklib for different electrodes. Same color for two electrodes means they are shorted. Then we get `./f3d/htrap_overhang_9x5mm_my_colored.f3d`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then export to an stl file in fusion360 file>export tab and move the file in `./inter_results`\n",
    "\n",
    "(here we cut our trap into a smaller one, i.e. `./f3d/htrap_overhang_9x5mm_my_colored_cut.f3d`, before exporting, because distant electrode parts have little influence)\n",
    "\n",
    "( WHY USE STANDARD COLOR? We define a set of standard color lib ../../../bemCol_lib/bemCol.adsklib for two reasons: 1. when exporting to .stl file, fusion 360 will compress 0-256 color(RGBA32) into 0-32 color(RGBA16), which means that some similar colors in fusion 360 will become same color after export to .stl file. Our standard color lib avoid this problem. 2.If you use .stl file exported from fusion 360 DIRECTLY, naming the electrodes would be very convinient. If you use other apps such as Inventor or Meshlab to generate .stl file, you can ignore the second reason because color encoding are quite different in different apps)\n",
