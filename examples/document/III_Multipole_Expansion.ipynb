    "This document helps you generate a pickle file(.pkl), which stores electric potential(or field) districution of one electrode at voltalge 1V and other elctrodes at voltalge 0V. With this pickle file(.pkl), you can analyze various properties of field distribution for arbitrary electrode voltage configuration, of which we concern about multipole expansion the most.

    "A trap always divide into different part(different electrodes). Here we use color to identify different electrodes(STL file stores color for each mesh). This step assign a name for each color(i.e. each electrode).\n",

    "( We define a set of standard color lib ../../../bemCol_lib/bemCol.adsklib for two reasons: 1. when exporting to .stl file, fusion 360 will compress 0-256 color(RGBA32) into 0-32 color(RGBA16), which means that some similar colors in fusion 360 will become same color after export to .stl file. Our standard color lib avoid this problem. 2.If you use .stl file exported from fusion 360 DIRECTLY, naming the electrodes would be very convinient. If you use other apps such as Inventor or Meshlab to generate .stl file, you can ignore this second reason because color encoding are quite different in different apps)\n",
