    "This BEM package is used for for numerical simulation of the electric field of ion traps in python. Some external packages are wrapped into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fast triangulation (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.research.html)\n",
    "* fastlap boundary element method (Nabors K S. Efficient three-dimensional capacitance calculation[D]. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document, also as a tutorial, explains how to use these packages to compute the electric field and compute its multipole expansion coefficient starting from scratch with a fusion 360 trap model(take `./f3d/htrap_overhang_9x5mm.f3d` for example). Our document consists of three .ipynb files: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `I_Mesh_Processing.ipynb`\n",
    "* `II_Field_Simulation.ipynb`\n",
    "* `III_Multipole_Expansion.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "We split the document into three files for two reasons:\n",
    "1. The most time consuming part `II_Field_Simulation.ipynb` could be taken out alone and run on a high peformance computer. \n",
    "2. The intermediate result between files can be checked- 'intermediate files' refer to the inital mesh grid (that corresponds to the charge distribution), the simulation values and the simulation coordinates, all of which are saved in the inter_results folder. So if the voltage solution files for the trap don't make sense, it is possible to go back through saved data to see where things have gone wrong. \n",
    "Here are the three jupyter notebooks and what:\n",
    "1. I_Mesh_Processing- this notebook generates a mesh of the trap, saved in inter_results as a .pkl file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through three files in order and running their python code will help you understand our workflow. Generally our workflow divides into three steps, corresponding to the above three .ipynb files. First, in I_Mesh_Processing, we identify different electrodes of the trap model by different colors. Also, we refine the trap model meshes to prepare for the second step. The result is stored in `mesh_result.pkl`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, in II_Field_Simulation, we simulate the electric potential with fastlap boundary element method(FMM), the accuracy of this step depends on the mesh size in the first step. The result is stored in `field_result.pkl`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, in III_Multipole_Expansion, we analyze the electric field and electric potential. This notebook generates the multipole coefficients of the fields and potentials for each electrode and uses that information to generate a solution file with the function call `write_csv`. If your solution don't make sense, a good place to start is to insure that the mesh you are using is fine enough (generate several field results for different meshes)- if the potentials and fields are converging to specific values, this suggests there is something wrong with the multipole expansion. If you start with multipole expansion, you do not know if it is a problem with the expansion or with the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running codes, you must set up the environment according to instructions in `README`\n",
    "\n",
    "notes\n",
    "* Our workflow, as indicated by this document, abandons mayavi(with its embeded package tvtk). But we reserve mayavi in our Bem source code, if you want to use mayavi related functions, you must set up environment with files in`./backup/setup_with_mayavi`, just replace corresponding files in the root folder with them and set up.\n",
    "    * why we abandon mayavi: because its python interface(with its dependence vtk and PyQt5) requires complex package dependencies and version controls especially for new python versions. This makes it difficult to maintain this project.\n",
    "    * why we still keep mayavi in the source code? Because it is rooted in our source code deeply. We can just avoid invoking related functions instead of deleting them, because they may make sense in the future."

Here we use different color to identify different electrodes(STL file stores color for each mesh). In fusion 360, you can assign different appearance for different electrodes. We recommend to use ../../bemCol_lib/bemCol.adsklib for different electrodes. Same color for two electrodes means they are treated as the same electrode.

    "* Why use standard color? We define a set of standard color lib `../../../bemCol_lib/bemCol.adsklib` for two reasons: 1. when exporting to .stl file, fusion 360 will compress 0-256 color(RGBA32) into 0-32 color(RGBA16), which means that some similar colors in fusion 360 will become same color after export to .stl file. Our standard color lib avoid this problem. 2.If you use .stl file exported from fusion 360 DIRECTLY, naming the electrodes would be very convinient. If you use other apps such as Inventor or Meshlab to generate .stl file, you can ignore the second reason because color encoding are quite different in different apps\n",
